# PROJECTS :

**1. Word Guessing Game**

Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! This is a fun, interactive game where players guess a hidden word letter by letter. The game provides hints for each word and visually represents incorrect guesses with a hangman figure.

**Features**

1. **Hint System:** Each word comes with a hint to help you guess the word.
2. **Dynamic Attempts:** The number of attempts to guess the word is dynamically set based on the word's length.
3. **Graphical User Interface:** The game features a user-friendly interface built with Tkinter.
4. **Visual Feedback:** Correct guesses are displayed in green, incorrect guesses in red, and repeated guesses in orange. Feedback messages are displayed for 2 seconds.
5. **Hangman Drawing:** Incorrect guesses are visually represented by a progressively drawn hangman figure in the center of the display area.
   
**How to Play**

1. **Start the Game:** Run the main.py file.
2. **Enter the Path to the Word Library:** Provide the path to a text file containing words and hints.
3. **Guess Letters:** Enter letters to guess the hidden word. You have a limited number of attempts based on the word's length.
4. **Feedback and Hints:** Use the hint provided and the feedback from your guesses to figure out the word.

**2. Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using Python's Tkinter library. The game allows two players to compete against each other and keeps track of the scores. The top 3 players' scores are displayed after each game.

**Features**

1. **Two Player Mode:** Allows two players to play the game alternately.
2. **Score Tracking:** Keeps track of players' scores and updates them after each game.
3. **Top Players Display:** Shows the top 3 players with the highest scores.
4. **Simple UI:** User-friendly interface created with Tkinter.

**How to Use**

1. **Start the Game:** Enter the names of Player 1 (X) and Player 2 (O) and click "Start Game".
2. **Play the Game:** Click on the buttons on the game board to make your move. The current player's symbol (X or O) will be displayed on the button.
3. **Winning the Game:** The game checks for a winner after each move. If a player wins, a message box will display the winner's name and the score will be updated.
4. **Draw:** If all cells are filled and there is no winner, the game ends in a draw.
5. **Top Players:** After each game, the top 3 players' scores are displayed.

**Creating Your Own Score File**

You can create your own text file for scoring the game. The file should be named gamescores2.tx and if you want to give it some other name, then create a new text file with the name you want and place it in the same directory as the game script.

**3. Number Guessing Game**

This project is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python using the Tkinter library for graphical user interface (GUI). The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player has a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number. Feedback is provided based on the proximity of each guess to the target number, with messages displayed in different colors for added clarity and engagement.

**Features:**

1. **Random Number Generation:** The game generates a random number between 1 and 100 each time it is played.
2. **Limited Attempts:** Players have a maximum of 4 attempts to guess the correct number.
3. **Proximity Messages:** Different messages are displayed based on how close the guess is to the target number:
"Ahh, you're very close!" when within 5 units.
"Alright... you are close." when within 10 units.
"Too low! Try again." or "Too high! Try again." depending on whether the guess is below or above the target number.
4. **GUI with Tkinter:** The game features a simple GUI built with Tkinter, including a text entry field for guesses, a submit button, and dynamic labels for feedback and hint display.
5. **Dynamic Message Display:** Messages are displayed in different colors (e.g., red, green, orange, yellow, purple) to indicate different states or feedback.
6. **User Interaction:** Players interact with the game through the GUI, entering their guesses and receiving immediate feedback on their progress towards guessing the correct number.

**Usage:**

1. Clone the repository or download the number_guessing_game.py file.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Run the game by executing python number_guessing_game.py in your terminal or command prompt.
4. Enter your guesses in the provided entry field and click "Submit Guess" to see feedback based on your guess.
